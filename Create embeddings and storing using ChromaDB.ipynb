A few there were, who seemed unmindful of \\nhim, and looked only to the jury, in impatient wonder how \\nthey could delay. But in no one face—not even among the \\nwomen, of whom there were many there—could he read the \\nfaintest sympathy with himself, or any feeling but one of all-\\nabsorbing interest that he should be condemned.\\nAs he saw all this in one bewildered glance, the deathlike \\nstillness came again, and looking back he saw that the jury -\\nmen had turned towards the judge.

He is accordingly visited by Mr. \\nGrimwig a great many times in the course of the year. On \\nall such occasions, Mr. Grimwig plants, fishes, and carpen -\\nters, with great ardour; doing everything in a very singular \\nand unprecedented manner, but always maintaining with \\nhis favourite asseveration, that his mode is the right one. \\nOn Sundays, he never fails to criticise the sermon to the \\nyoung clergyman’s face: always informing Mr. Losberne, in \\nstrict confidence afterwards, that he considers it an excel -\\nlent performance, but deems it as well not to say so. It is a \\nstanding and very favourite joke, for Mr. Brownlow to rally \\nhim on his old prophecy concerning Oliver, and to remind \\nhim of the night on which they sat with the watch between \\nthem, waiting his return; but Mr. Grimwig contends that he \\nwas right in the main, and, in proof thereof, remarks that \\nOliver did not come back after all; which always calls forth \\na laugh on his side, and increases his good humour.\\nMr. Noah Claypole: receiving a free pardon from the \\nCrown in consequence of being admitted approver against \\nFagin: and considering his profession not altogether as safe \\na one as he could wish: was, for some little time, at a loss' metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Oliver Twist.pdf', 'page': 136}\n",

Mr. Bumble has been heard \\nto say, that in this reverse and degradation, he has not even \\nspirits to be thankful for being separated from his wife.\\nAs to Mr. Giles and Brittles, they still remain in their old \\nposts, although the former is bald, and the last-named boy \\nquite grey. They sleep at the parsonage, but divide their at -\\ntentions so equally among its inmates, and Oliver and Mr. \\nBrownlow, and Mr. Losberne, that to this day the villagers \\nhave never been able to discover to which establishment \\nthey properly belong.\\nMaster Charles Bates, appalled by Sikes’s crime, fell into \\na train of reflection whether an honest life was not, after \\nall, the best.
